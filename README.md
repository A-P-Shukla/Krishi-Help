## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Akhil9648/Krishi-Help.git
    cd Krishi-Help
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    The `requirements.txt` file contains the following :
    ```
    Flask
    numpy
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    joblib
    python-dotenv
    requests
    google-generativeai
    ```
    Install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    *   Add your API keys to this file:
        ```env
        OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"
        GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        ```
    *   Replace `"YOUR_..."` with your actual API keys.

5.  **Ensure Model Files are Present:**
    *   The trained model files (`crop_model.pkl`, `sc.pkl`, `mx.pkl`, `fertilizer.pkl`, `crop_price.pkl`, `min_max_scaler.pkl`, `model_columns.pkl`, `original_numerical_cols.pkl`, `original_categorical_cols.pkl`) should be present in the `models/` directory. These are typically generated during the model training phase which is not part of this run-time setup.

6.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

7.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
